# What to do to improve this github :)

List of all the things I need to do to improve this repo !

## Problems where I'm not fond of my solution and thus have to be optimized
### Because of brute forcing
- [ ] Problem 2
- [ ] Problem 9
- [ ] Problem 10
- [ ] Problem 12
- [ ] ...

### Because the solution is not generalizable
- [ ] Problem 11
- [ ] ...

### Because I don't even know what the function does anymore
- [ ] Problem 30
- [ ] ...

### Skipped
- [ ] Problem 17
- [ ] Problem 31
- [ ] ...

## Repo modifications

### Files
- [ ] generate requirements.txt
- [ ] generate environments.ylm
- [ ] Adding awards to README.md
- [ ] Adding milestones to README.md
- [ ] Adding benchmark to README.md

## Modifications to be done

### Cleaning the code
- [ ] Moving helpers functions used in multiple problems to util
- [ ] Moving helpers function used in a single problem outside of class (Bad design from me!)

### Adding features
- [ ] Adding sub-parser to change the parameters of the problems to enable generalization of my functions !
- [ ] Setting the size of cmd window to either a fix value or depending of what problem.print_problem() will print

### Improve
- [ ] Adding a function to generate a benchmark of my solutions (time_taken...)

### Fixing
- [ ] Formatting of statement and detailed_message not good enough yet
- [ ] How to handle picture of Problem #0084

## If unicorns exist...
- [ ] Implement UI using tkinter or other library... but honestly how this project works in cmd seems plenty enough to me and would more be another challenge :-)


## Done âœ“

- [x] Structured the repo !
- [x] Added the first 10 problems !
- [x] Adding pictures to cmd (for example to print the picture in Problem 15's statement)
- [x] Created and moved consts to util.const
- [x] Adding an automatic tester for when I try to change an existing solution
- [x] Better print of statements by first translating LateX then html
- [x] Adding and formatting the ~100 problems I've solved !
