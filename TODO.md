# What to do to improve this github :)

List of all the things I need to do to improve this repo !

## Problems where I'm not fond of my solution and thus have to be optimized
### Because of brute forcing
- [ ] Problem 2
- [ ] Problem 9
- [ ] Problem 10
- [ ] Problem 12

### Because the solution is not generalizable
- [ ] Problem 11

## Repo modifications
### Growing the repository
- [ ] Adding and formatting the ~100 problems I've solved !

### Files
- [ ] generate requirements.txt
- [ ] generate environments.ylm

## Modifications to be done

### Cleaning the code
- [ ] Moving problem-specific helpers functions to util

### Adding features
- [ ] Adding sub-parser to change the parameters of the problems
- [ ] Setting the size of cmd window to either a fix value or depending of what problem.print_problem() will print
- [ ] Adding an automatic tester for when I try to change an existing solution

### Fixing
- [ ] Formatting of statement and detailed_message not good enough yet


## Done âœ“

- [x] Structured the repo !
- [x] added the first 10 problems !
